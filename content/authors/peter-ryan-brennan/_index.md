Though my background is primarily rooted in geology and geosciences (B.S. in Environmental Geosciences from Boston College, Class of 2017--go eagles!), the latter half of my PhD has led me to the realization that climate data science (however one might actually define that) is where my current and future interests lie. I've always been mathematically inclined so when I first discovered and learned to code in Matlab back in 2019, the apparent capability of coding to study climate change quickly grabbed my attention. Later, as I started to dabble in Python and R, I became even more acutely aware of the dearth of climate scientists who can both succinctly and accurately describe complex climate dynamics and can write a Python script to analyze and visualize those dynamics. It has been and will be a goal of mine to bridge that gap and utilize my unique background to prepare for and mitigate future climate change, whether in academia or industry.
